# Mjolnir

A map editor that I'm making for GoldSrc. Originally it was going to be only for my game engine, KosmicTec, but since I am only one person working on my game engine,
I think it's going to take a pretty long time to finish everything, so I decided to also make a GoldSrc version of my map editor, as a way to open-source one of my tools early.

I am open-sourcing this tool in hopes that some humble programmer, probably from the GoldSrc community, could help me out and finish this tool. Not only it benefits me,
but I think it also benefits the GoldSrc community, because I know there's some people who find Hammer to be much easier to use than Trenchbroom, and there is a lack
of open-source tools that are similar to Hammer, so that's my other reason why I am open-sourcing this tool.

At this moment, it's at its prototype stages, or at alpha version, so it is very unfinished.

## Some building information

You need Visual Studio 2013 to be able to build this program. The project is inside the VS2013 folder, the wxWidgets 2.8.6 libs are included in the project, you just have to grab the include headers from somewhere else.

I might upgrade wxWidgets one day.
